# metahealth-brainstation-capstone
Capstone project for BrainStation Web Development program. Metahealth's primary purpose is to help people track their long-term health trends based on their diet. The app will support them with meal prepping and shopping based on these goals. 

In two bullets:
- Tracking your health trends based on your diet
- Supporting you to meal prep and shop based on these goals

For example, a user can input “I'm a vegetarian, allergic to nuts, and I want a high iron diet” and you'll be shown recipes that meet those requirements in a usable meal planning interface. Nutrition stats will be drawn from the recipes and will be visually graphed based on the RDA.
Then, you will be asked to track your sleep quality, energy levels, feeling of contentedness, and exercise on a scale of 1-10. Finally, you will be able to visualize those weekly health points alongside what you've been eating. The goal of both sets of data will be to attempt to draw correlations between, for example, increased iron or reduced dairy, higher iron levels with your mood/sleep/happiness.
